Plug in your Oculus Rift (designed for development kit version) and run the FlyPyValley.py file (with appropriate modules installed, see below) to begin flying around a 3D textured valley. Look around you in the Oculus Rift and use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to help orient you in the 3D world. Fly forward or backward using the UP or DOWN arrows, respectively.\r\n\r\nFor singleplayer gameplay:\r\nOpen FlyPyValley.py in an editor and ensure that 'multiplayerFlag' on the second-to-last line of code is set to False. Then, run the python file and enjoy flying solo on a randomly selected map from an assortment of greatly varying heightmaps/terrain files. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nAn added bonus for online multiplayer!:\r\nRun the GameServer.py in terminal on an appropriate machine (preferrably a desktop or a computer with a stable internet connection and/or a static IP address), copy and paste the printed IP address from the terminal output into the FlyPyVallley.py file's variable \"self.remoteHost\" on the 'client' machines (one of which can be on the server machine). Then plug in Oculus Rift's into each machine, run FlyPyValley.py (after setting the multiplayerFlag at the end of the file to True) and enjoy flying around a 3D valley with your friends!\r\nSee MultiplayerHowTo.txt for more details...\r\n\r\nImportant Modules:\r\nsocket \t\t\t(pre-installed with Python 2.7 for Linux)\r\n\r\nImage\t(extract tar.gz file from this link <http://effbot.org/downloads/Imaging-1.1.7.tar.gz> and follow build instructions in README)\r\n\r\nnumpy (follow instructions at <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html> to download and install on appropriate platform)\r\n\r\nmath \t\t\t(pre-installed module with Python 2.7)\r\n\r\ntime \t\t\t(pre-installed module with Python 2.7)\r\n\r\nTkinter\t\t\t(pre-installed module with Python 2.7)\r\n\r\nQueue\t\t\t(pre-installed module with Python 2.7)\r\n\r\nthread\t \t\t(pre-installed module with Python 2.7)\r\n\r\npyrift\t\t\t(download the zip file on GitHub link:\r\n<https://github.com/wwwtyro/pyrift>\r\nExtract the folder and then use the terminal/command line to install the module into your Python path by following these instructions:\r\n1) cd into the downloaded/extracted directory.\r\n2) enter \"python setup.py install\" to install the setup.py file\r\n3) You may need root access, see online for appropriate Terminal/CMD commands for gaining root access (i.e., for Linux, use \"sudo python setup.py install\")\r\n\r\nPyOpenGL module \t(download appropriate compressed file or exe file at <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyOpenGL/3.1.0b2> for version 3.1.0b2 of PyOpenGL, extract the files to an appropriate location, and run \"python setup.py install\" in the terminal in this directory)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
